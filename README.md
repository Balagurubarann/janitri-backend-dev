API TESTING IN POSTMAN:
	We have the API endpoints mentioned in the API DOCUMENTATION, with that endpoints and refer the sample request body data, then create a new POST/GET request in postman as per endpoints and functionality.


MY VIEWS:
  Models used in the project are made up on own assumptions.
  I developed the endpoints as per project objectives.
  For authentication I used jsonwebtoken for token based authentication.

  NPM packages used:
    express, mongoose, dotenv, cookie-parser, bcryptjs, jsonwebtoken, nodemon

MY WORKS:
  I have my github. If your are interested in my work, please check https://github.com/Balagurubarann/
